         <h3>How To Play</h3>
         <p>
            The main goal of the game is fairly simply to understand. Upon starting, you will be
            asked to form a number of a specific molecule. This can be done by firing orbs that represent some common elements. 
            Until you have formed the compound listed, any other combinations of elements will not result in a molecule forming. 
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
            The game will end if you fill the screen with no room to make new elements.
